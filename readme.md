SETUP AND INSTALLATION:

1. Download node: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
    // download version 18.12.0 -- this should be labeled as "version reccomened for most users"
    // if not, then locate v18.12.0 and download that one

2. Open command-line and make sure you are in the CSCE-315-Project-3 directory

3. Type "node -v" to make sure you have node installed

4. Type "npm start" -- this should start up the server
    // NOTE: when I say "server" here, I do not mean the server GUI; I mean our Node.js back-end
5. If you are getting errors, try typing "npm i express", and then retry "npm start"
    // msg me in GroupMe with questions


RUNNING NODE AND REACT:
-To run the server: run "npm start" in the CSCE-315-Project-3 directory
-To run the client: (this is the React front-end) Open another terminal window and cd into the "client" directory.
 Then, run "npm start". // NOTE : make sure the server is running in another terminal window.
 If you're successfully running both, a chrome webpage with the React logo should open.
